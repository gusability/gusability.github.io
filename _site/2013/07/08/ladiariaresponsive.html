    <h1>Hey, ladiaria, You have been responsified!</h1>
<p>
  Instead of keep complaining about the lack of responsiveness of the
  local newspapers I use to read online, I decided to take the
  iniciative and responsify <a href="http://ladiaria.com.uy">ladiaria's website</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I have responsified only articles and sections, both the kind
  of pages I access more frequently from my mobile. Since I obviously wasn't able to
  rewrite the page structure (something I would've like to, since they're unfortunately
  serving HTML 4.01), I was constrained to overwrite the styles only.
</p>
<p>
  If the folks of ladiaria accept my suggestion, they should download
  <a href="https://raw.github.com/gusaaaaa/ladiaria-responsified/master/responsify.css" target="_blank">responsify.css</a> to the website's <code>media</code> directory and
  drop the following line in the head tag, after loading all the stylesheets:
  <code>&lt;link type="text/css" href="responsify.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
  Be warned that <a href="https://raw.github.com/gusaaaaa/ladiaria-responsified/master/responsify.css" target="_blank">responsify.css</a> is intended only for articles and
  sections, so load it when rendering those pages only.
</p>
<p>
  I hope the folks of ladiaria understand the importance of moving towards a 
  responsive experience and accept this challenge.
